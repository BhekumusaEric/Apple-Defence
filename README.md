# Apple-Defence

A revolutionary red agent and blue agent twin security project for iOS defence.

## Overview

Apple-Defence is a groundbreaking security project that leverages artificial intelligence to create a self-improving security system for iOS devices. The system consists of two AI agents:

1. **Red Agent**: An offensive security AI that discovers and exploits vulnerabilities in iOS systems
2. **Blue Agent**: A defensive security AI that learns from the Red Agent's exploits and implements fixes

This twin-agent approach creates a continuous security improvement cycle, ensuring absolute security for users, software, and hardware by proactively finding and fixing vulnerabilities before they can be exploited in the wild.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Vulnerability Discovery**: The Red Agent continuously scans for potential security vulnerabilities in iOS systems
- **Exploit Simulation**: Safely simulates exploits in a sandboxed environment to test vulnerability impact
- **Real-time Threat Analysis**: The Blue Agent analyzes discovered vulnerabilities to determine severity and impact
- **Automated Patch Generation**: Generates security patches to fix vulnerabilities
- **Continuous Learning**: Both agents learn from each interaction, improving their capabilities over time
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed security reports with vulnerability and patch information

## Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.8 or higher
- PyTorch 1.10 or higher
- Additional dependencies listed in requirements.txt

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/BhekumusaEric/Apple-Defence.git
   cd Apple-Defence
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the system:
   ```
   python main.py --config config.yaml --duration 300
   ```

## Usage

The system can be configured using the `config.yaml` file, which allows you to customize:

- Target iOS versions and device types
- Scanning and monitoring intervals
- Exploit and patching modules to use
- Analysis thresholds and parameters

After running the system, a comprehensive security report will be generated in JSON format, detailing discovered vulnerabilities and applied patches.

## Impact

This project will change the way we think about security by:

1. Shifting from reactive to proactive security measures
2. Creating a self-improving security system that gets stronger over time
3. Providing comprehensive protection against unknown vulnerabilities
4. Ensuring there are no loopholes in iOS systems running on user devices
